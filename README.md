### Overview of Findings

1. **YoY Revenue Growth**: In 2018, revenue grew to $7,386,050, marking a 19.99% year-over-year increase.

- **2017 Revenue Growth and Q4 Peak**:  
  In **2017, revenue steadily increased from Q1 to Q4**, with a peak in **November 2017 at $1,010,271**, most likely driven by holiday shopping for **Christmas**.

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Year-over-Year Revenue Growth**: Revenue saw a notable increase of **19.99%** YoY, rising from **$6,155,806.98 in 2017** to **$7,386,050 in 2018**. It's important to note that the 2018 metric only includes data for the first three quarters, which highlights significant growth despite the incomplete data for the full year.

- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: The average order value slightly decreased from **$138.09 in 2017** to **$137.35 in 2018**, indicating a marginal reduction in spending per transaction, which could be attributed to shifts in customer behavior or product mix.

- **Top 5 Product Categories by Revenue**: The following product categories were the largest contributors to revenue:
  - **Bed, Bath & Tableware**
  - **Watches & Accessories**
  - **Health & Beauty**
  - **Sports & Leisure**
  - **Computer & Laptop Accessories**

  These top 5 categories accounted for **37.8% of total revenue in 2017** and **41.3% in the first three quarters of 2018**, underscoring their strong performance and consistent demand.

### Sales by Product Category

  * In both 2017 and 2018, revenue was heavily concentrated in a few key product categories. The top five **Bed, Bath & Tableware, Watches & Accessories, Health & Beauty, Sports & Leisure, and Computer & Laptop Accessories** accounted for **37.8% of total revenue in 2017** and increased their share to **41.3% in 2018**. The **high-spending customer segment** made up the largest percentage of sales and showed a strong preference for these top categories, further driving revenue growth in 2018.  

  * Seasonal trends played a significant role in category performance, with **Q4 of 2017 experiencing the highest revenue peak**, culminating in **November's total revenue of $1,010,271**, likely due to increased **holiday shopping activity**. During this period, **Watches & Accessories, Bed, Bath & Tableware, Health & Beauty, Sports & Leisure, and Toys & Games** generated the largest portion of revenue. This trend underscores the impact of seasonal demand on product category performance, particularly during the holiday season.  

  * While the top categories remained dominant, **some segments experienced shifts in demand**. **Electronics growth slowed**, possibly indicating **market saturation or increased competition**, while **mid-tier customers drove sales in Health & Beauty and Sports & Leisure**. The increase in revenue share from high-spending customers suggests **a greater concentration of purchases among premium buyers**, reinforcing the need to tailor product offerings and marketing strategies to high-value segments.  

### Payment Preference

<p align="center">
<img width="600" alt="PaymentMethods.png" src="https://github.com/JevaughnNewman/Target-E-Commerce-Sales-Data-Project/blob/e0db4600d80036b7aefc12fce017153d1e15b6ba/PaymentMethod.png">
</p>

  * Payment Preferences by Customer Spend Category: Credit cards and UPI (Unified Payments Interface) dominate as the preferred payment methods across all customer spend categories, accounting for approximately 96.44% of all transactions. Among these, credit cards remain the most widely used payment method, with customers consistently opting for this method for higher-value orders.
    
  * Unified Payments Interface (UPI): UPI, also known as PIX in Brazil, is a real-time payment system introduced by the Central Bank of Brazil (Banco Central do Brasil) in 2020. It allows users to make instant, secure payments around the clock, including weekends and holidays, at no cost. UPI has quickly gained traction, accounting for 19.29% of total transactions. The system enables quick and easy payments, often facilitated through QR code scanning, making it an attractive alternative for consumers.
    
  * It may be beneficial for Target Brazil to incentivize customers to utilize PIX more regularly due to the lower transaction fees compared to credit card payments. In addition to this, the speed and security of UPI may allow our customers to purchase more often.

# Recommendations

 1. **Payment Methods**: Incentivize UPI Adoption to Reduce Merchant Fees and Enhance Payment Efficiency
    
    * Lower Merchant Fees: UPI transactions have significantly lower or no fees compared to credit card payments, which can reduce overall transaction costs for the business.
    * Offer discounts, cashback, or loyalty rewards for customers who use UPI to increase its share from the current 19.29% of total transactions.
    * Educate customers on the security, speed, and convenience of UPI to drive long-term adoption.

 2. **Optimize Product Category Strategy for Seasonal Demand**: 

    * Leverage Q4 sales peaks by enhancing promotions and stock levels in Watches & Accessories, Bed, Bath & Tableware, Health & Beauty, Sports & Leisure, and Toys & Games, which performed best during the holiday season.
    * Expand product bundling and upsell strategies in top-selling categories to increase Average Order Value (AOV).
    * Use historical sales data to improve inventory planning and tailor marketing campaigns to maximize peak-season revenue.

 3. **Capitalize on High-Spending Customer Trends**: 

    * The high-spender segment is growing as a percentage of total orders and prefers the top revenue-generating categories.
    * Develop exclusive VIP programs, premium-tier discounts, and early-access sales for high-value customers to boost retention and revenue.
    * Use personalized promotions and targeted marketing based on past purchase behavior to maximize customer lifetime value.

 4. **Expand Focus on Mid-Tier Customers for Long-Term Growth**: 

    * While high spenders dominate revenue, mid-tier customers drove increased sales in Health & Beauty and Sports & Leisure, offering an opportunity for targeted growth.
    * Introduce flexible payment plans, loyalty incentives, and personalized promotions to encourage repeat purchases from this segment.
  
     
# Clarifying Questions, Assumptions and Caveats

### Questions for Stakeholders Before Project Advancement

   * Answer: Identify revenue trends, customer behaviour and the highest selling product categories

3. What data sources are available, and do we have full access to them?

   * Answer: Product sales data from Targetâ€™s international operations in Brazil. The dataset does not include specific product names or customer names to protect privacy. It covers Q4 2016, all of 2017, and Q1â€“Q3 of 2018.
   
5. Who is the primary audience for this analysis, and how will insights be used?

   * Answer: Executives and marketing teams. Insights will guide pricing, marketing, and inventory decisions.

### Assumptions and Caveats

#### Assumptions
- The provided dataset is **complete and accurate**, representing all transactions from the specified periods.  
- The **absence of specific product names and customer names** does not significantly impact the validity of customer behavior insights.  
- Sales trends from **Targetâ€™s international operations in Brazil** are reflective of broader e-commerce trends in that market.  

#### Caveats
- The dataset **only includes Q4 2016, all of 2017, and Q1â€“Q3 of 2018**, meaning **Q4 2018 is missing**, which may affect year-over-year comparisons.  
- Without customer-specific data:
  - **Repeat purchase behavior cannot be directly measured** and must be inferred from transaction details.  
  - **Customer segmentation is limited** to spending patterns rather than demographics.  
- **Macroeconomic factors** (e.g., inflation, currency fluctuations) that could impact purchasing behavior are **not accounted for** in this analysis.
